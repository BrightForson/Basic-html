# Basics Of HTML
This project is focused on applying the fundamentals of HTML I have learnt. I will be creating a static HTML pageðŸ™‚.
I just asked Chatgpt(It is now basically my coachðŸ˜‚ to give me a real life freelance client request and it says I should create a personal portfolio website for Jane Doe. So I'll apply what I've learnt into it.
